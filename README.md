# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

Through this project, I was able help enhance the accessibility and overall flow of the Horiseon webpage. This was accomplished by using the following acceptance criteria:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Following these criterias helped structure the code so that it appears more organized and mirrors HTML format. It also helped make the website more accessible by adding certain elements such as alt attributes and title. 

The CSS file was also altered to simplify certain aspects. Some of the classes were repeated for different sections; because they had the same functions, the ones that reflected the same fuctions were consolidated. This helps simplify the CSS file for organizational purposes.
